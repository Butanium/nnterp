# # Demo: nnterp Features Showcase
#
# This notebook demonstrates the key features of `nnterp`, which aims to offer a unified interface for all transformer models and give best `NNsight` practices for LLMs in everyone's hands.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 1. Standardized Interface
#
# Similar to [`transformer_lens`](https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens), `nnterp` provides a standardized interface for all transformer models.
# The main difference is that `nnterp` still uses the huggingface implementation under the hood through `NNsight`, while transformer_lens uses its own implementation of the transformer architecture. However, each transformer implementation has its own quirks, such that `transformer_lens` is not able to support all models, and can sometimes have significant difference with the huggingface implementation.
#
# Note that `nnterp` doesn't support all models either, since `NNsight` itself doesn't support all architectures. Additionally, because different models use different naming conventions, `nnterp` doesn't support all HuggingFace models, but it does support a good portion of them. When a model is loaded in `nnterp`, automatic tests are performed to verify that the model has been correctly renamed and that `nnterp`'s hooks return the expected shapes. This means that even if an architecture hasn't been officially tested, the simple fact that it loads successfully indicates it's probably working correctly.
#
# The way it's implemented is based on the `NNsight` built-in renaming feature, to make all models look like the llama naming convention, without having to write `model.model`, namely:
# ```ocaml
# StandardizedTransformer
# ├── embed_tokens
# ├── layers
# │   ├── self_attn
# │   └── mlp
# ├── ln_final
# └── lm_head
# ```

# %%
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

print(AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Maykeye/TinyLLama-v0"))
print(AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2"))

# %% [markdown]
# As you can see, the naming scheme of gpt2 is different from the llama naming convention.
# A simple way to fix this is to use the `rename` feature of `NNsight` to rename the gpt2 modules to the llama naming convention.

# %%
from nnsight import LanguageModel

model = LanguageModel(
    "gpt2",
    rename=dict(transformer="model", h="layers", ln_f="ln_final", attn="self_attn"),
)
print(model)
# Access the attn module as if it was a llama model
print(model.model.layers[0].self_attn)

# %% [markdown]
# You can see the that renamed modules are displayed like `(new_name)/old_name`. However, many models family have their own naming convention, `nnterp` has a global renaming scheme that should transform any model to the llama naming convention. The easiest way to use it is to load your model using the `StandardizedTransformer` class that inherits from `nnsight.LanguageModel`.

# %%
from nnterp import StandardizedTransformer

# You will see the `layers` module printed two times, it'll be explained later.
nnterp_gpt2 = StandardizedTransformer("gpt2")
print(nnterp_gpt2)
# StandardizedTransformer also use `device_map="auto"` by default:
nnterp_gpt2.dispatch()
print(nnterp_gpt2.model.device)

# %% [markdown]
# Great! But I can see you at the back of the classroom, asking yourself:
# > "Why would you create a package that just pass the right dict to the `NNsight` `rename` feature?"
#
# And actually, I'm glad you asked! `StandardizedTransformer` and `nnterp` have a lot of other features, so bear with me!

# %% [markdown]
# ## 2. Accessing Modules I/O
# With `NNsight`, the most robust way to set the residual stream after layer 1 to be the residual stream after layer 0 for a LLama-like model would be:

# %%
from transformers import __version__ as TRANSFORMERS_VERSION
from packaging.version import parse
llama = LanguageModel("Maykeye/TinyLLama-v0")
# code for transformer "<4.54"
is_old_transformers = parse(TRANSFORMERS_VERSION) < parse("4.54")
if is_old_transformers:
    with llama.trace("hello"):
        llama.model.layers[1].output = (
            llama.model.layers[0].output[0],
            *llama.model.layers[1].output[1:],
        )
else:
    with llama.trace("hello"):
        llama.model.layers[1].output = llama.model.layers[0].output


# %% [markdown]
# Note that the following can cause issues:

# %%
with llama.trace("hello"):
    # can't do this because .output is a tuple

    # Can cause errors with gradient computation
    if is_old_transformers:
        # llama.model.layers[1].output[0] = llama.model.layers[0].output[0]
        llama.model.layers[1].output[0][:] = llama.model.layers[0].output[0]
    else:
        llama.model.layers[1].output[:] = llama.model.layers[0].output

if is_old_transformers:
    with llama.trace("hello"):
        # Can cause errors with opt if you do this at its last layer (thanks pytest)
        llama.model.layers[1].output = (llama.model.layers[0].output[0],)

# %% [markdown]
# `nnterp` makes this much cleaner:

# %%
# the version of transformers does not matter, the tuple vs not tuple stuff is handled internally
# First, you can access layer inputs and outputs directly:
with nnterp_gpt2.trace("hello"):
    # Access layer 5's output
    layer_5_output = nnterp_gpt2.layers_output[5]
    # Set layer 10's output to be layer 5's output
    nnterp_gpt2.layers_output[10] = layer_5_output

# You can also access attention and MLP outputs:
with nnterp_gpt2.trace("hello"):
    attn_output = nnterp_gpt2.attentions_output[3]
    mlp_output = nnterp_gpt2.mlps_output[3]

# %% [markdown]
# ## 3. `nnterp` Guarantees
#

# %% [markdown]
# When designing, `nnterp` I was very worried about silent failures, where you load a model, and then get an unexpected failure in your code downstream, or worst, it doesn't fail but give you fake results. To avoid this, when you load an `nnterp` model, a series of fast tests are run to ensure that:
# - The model has been correctly renamed
# - The model module output are of the expected shape
# - Attention probabilities have the right shape, sum to 1, and changing them changes the output
#
# This comes with the trade-off that `nnterp` will dispatch your model when you load it, which can be annoying if you don't want to load the model's weights. Also to be able to access the attention probabibilties, `nnterp` loads your model with the `eager` attention implementation, which can be slower than the default hf implementation. If you don't need the attention probabilities, you can force to use the default hf implementation / another one by passing `attn_implementation=None` or `attn_implementation="your_implementation"`.
#
# What `nnterp` can NOT guarantee:
# - The attention probabilities won't be modified by the model before being multiplied by the values. To ensure this, you can check `model.attention_probabilities.print_source()` (preferably in a notebook for markdown display) to understand where the attention probabilities are computed.
# - Huggingface's transformers sheringan w
#
# If youe model is not properly renamed, you can pass a `RenameConfig` to the `nnterp` constructor to rename the model. See more in the advanced usage section of this demo.
#
# On top of that, before releasing a new version of `nnterp`, a series of tests covering most architectures are performed. When you load a model, `nnterp` will check if tests were run for your `nnsight` and `transformers` versions, and will check the tests results for the class of your model. I chose to include the tests in the `nnterp` package, so that if your model architecture has not been tested / you use a different version of `nnsight` or `transformers`, you can run `python -m nnterp run_tests --model-names foo bar --class-names LlamaForCausalLM` to run the tests for your model. `--class-names` allow you to run the tests on a toy model of the same class as your model to make it cheaper and faster.

# %% [markdown]
# ## 4. Attention Probabilities
#
# For models that support it, you can access attention probabilities directly. You can check if a model supports it by calling `model.supports_attention_probabilities`.

# %%
import torch as th

nnterp_gpt2.tokenizer.padding_side = (
    "left"  # ensure left padding for easy access to the first token
)

with th.no_grad():
    with nnterp_gpt2.trace("The cat sat on the mat"):
        # Access attention probabilities for layer 5
        attn_probs_l2 = nnterp_gpt2.attention_probabilities[2].save()
        attn_probs = nnterp_gpt2.attention_probabilities[5].save()
        print(
            f"Attention probs shape will be: (batch, heads, seq_len, seq_len): {attn_probs.shape}"
        )
        # knock out the attention to the first token
        attn_probs[:, :, :, 0] = 0
        attn_probs /= attn_probs.sum(dim=-1, keepdim=True)
        corr_logits = nnterp_gpt2.logits.save()
    with nnterp_gpt2.trace("The cat sat on the mat"):
        baseline_logits = nnterp_gpt2.logits.save()

assert not th.allclose(corr_logits, baseline_logits)

sums = attn_probs_l2.sum(dim=-1)
# last dimension is the attention of token i to all other tokens, so should sum to 1
assert th.allclose(sums, th.ones_like(sums))

# %% [markdown]
# Under the hood this uses the new tracing system implemented in `NNsight v0.5` which allow to access most model intermediate variables during the forward pass. This means that if the `transformers` implementation were to change, this could break or give unexpected results, so it is recommended to use one of the tested versions of `transformers` and to check that the attention probabilities hook makes sense by calling `model.attention_probabilities.print_source()` if you want to use a different version of `transformers` / a architecture that has not been tested.

# ## 5. Builtin interventions
#
# `StandardizedTransformer` also provides convenient methods for common operations:

# Project hidden states to vocabulary using the unembed norm and lm_head
with nnterp_gpt2.trace("The capital of France is"):
    hidden = nnterp_gpt2.layers_output[5]

# Skip layers entirely
with nnterp_gpt2.trace("Hello world"):
    # Skip layer 1
    nnterp_gpt2.skip_layer(1)
    # Skip layers 2 through 3 (inclusive)
    nnterp_gpt2.skip_layers(2, 3)

# This is useful if you want to start at a later layer than the first one
with nnterp_gpt2.trace("Hello world") as tracer:
    layer_6_out = nnterp_gpt2.layers_output[6].save()
    tracer.stop()  # avoid computations after layer 6

# Direct steering
steering_vector = th.randn(768)  # gpt2 hidden size
with nnterp_gpt2.trace("The weather today is"):
    nnterp_gpt2.steer(layers=[1, 3], steering_vector=steering_vector, factor=0.5)

# %% [markdown]
# ## 6. Specific Token Activation Collection
#
# `nnterp` provides utilities for collecting activations efficiently:

# %%
from nnterp.nnsight_utils import (
    get_token_activations,
    collect_token_activations_batched,
)

# Collect activations for specific tokens
prompts = ["The capital of France is", "The weather today is"]
with nnterp_gpt2.trace(prompts) as tracer:
    # Get last token activations for all layers
    activations = get_token_activations(nnterp_gpt2, prompts, idx=-1, tracer=tracer)
    # activations shape: (num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)

# For large datasets, use batched collection
large_prompts = ["Sample text " + str(i) for i in range(100)]
batch_activations = collect_token_activations_batched(
    nnterp_gpt2,
    large_prompts,
    batch_size=16,
    layers=[3, 9, 11],  # Only collect specific layers, default is all layers
    idx=-1,  # Last token (default)
)
print(f"Batched activations shape: {batch_activations.shape}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## 7. Prompt Utilities
#
# `nnterp` provides utilities for working with prompts and tracking probabilities of first tokens of certain strings. It tracks both the first token of "string" and " string".
#
# You can provide multiple string per category, the probabilities returned will be the sum of the probabilities of all the first tokens of the strings.

# %%
from nnterp.prompt_utils import Prompt, run_prompts

# Create prompts with target tokens to track
prompt1 = Prompt.from_strings(
    "The capital of France (not England or Spain) is",
    {
        "target": "Paris",
        "traps": ["London", "Madrid"],
        "longstring": "the country of France",
    },
    nnterp_gpt2.tokenizer,
)
for name, tokens in prompt1.target_tokens.items():
    print(f"{name}: {nnterp_gpt2.tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(tokens)}")

prompt2 = Prompt.from_strings(
    "The largest planet (not Earth or Neptune) is",
    {"target": "Jupiter", "traps": ["Earth", "Neptune"], "longstring": "Palace planet"},
    nnterp_gpt2.tokenizer,
)
for name, tokens in prompt2.target_tokens.items():
    print(f"{name}: {nnterp_gpt2.tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(tokens)}")

# Run prompts and get probabilities for target tokens
results = run_prompts(nnterp_gpt2, [prompt1, prompt2], batch_size=2)
print("Target token probabilities:")
for target, probs in results.items():
    print(f"  {target}: shape {probs.shape}")

# %% [markdown]
# ## 8. Interventions
#
# `nnterp` provides several intervention methods inspired by mechanistic interpretability research:

# %%
from nnterp.interventions import (
    logit_lens,
    patchscope_lens,
    TargetPrompt,
    repeat_prompt,
    steer,
)

# Logit Lens: See predictions at each layer
prompts = ["The capital of France is", "The sun rises in the"]
probs = logit_lens(nnterp_gpt2, prompts)
print(f"Logit lens output shape: {probs.shape}")  # (batch, layers, vocab)

# Patchscope: Replace activations from one context into another
source_prompts = ["Paris is beautiful", "London is foggy"]
custom_target_prompt = TargetPrompt("city: Paris\nfood: croissant\n?", -1)
target_prompt = repeat_prompt()  # Creates a repetition task
custom_repeat_prompt = repeat_prompt(
    words=["car", "cross", "azdrfa"],

with nnterp_gpt2.trace("The weather is"):
    steer(nnterp_gpt2, layers=[5, 10], steering_vector=steering_vector)

# %% [markdown]
# You can use a combination of run_prompts and interventions to get the probabilities of certain tokens according to your custom intervention.

# ## 9. Visualization
#
# Finally, `nnterp` provides visualization utilities for analyzing model probabilities and prompts:

# %%
from nnterp.display import plot_topk_tokens, prompts_to_df

probs = logit_lens(demo_model, prompts_str[0])
# Visualize top tokens from logit lens
plot_topk_tokens(
    probs[0],
    demo_model.tokenizer,
    k=5,
    width=1000,
    height=1000,
    title="Top 5 tokens at each layer for 'The translation of 'car' in French is",
)

# Convert prompts to DataFrame for analysis
df = prompts_to_df(prompts, demo_model.tokenizer)
print("\nPrompts DataFrame:")
display(df)

# %% [markdown]
# # Advanced usage

# %% [markdown]
# Sometime, your model might not be supported yet by nnterp. In this case, you'll be able to use a `RenameConfig` to properly initialize your model.
#
# In this section, I'll show you the steps I took to add support for the `gpt2` to `nnterp`.

# %% [markdown]
# ###  Renaming a module not automatically renamed
#
# Let's say that you load a `gpt2` model that is a bit special: every module is called "super_module" instead of "module".
#
# First, let's build such a model:

# %%
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
for layer in model.transformer.h:
    layer.super_mlp = layer.mlp
    delattr(layer, "mlp")
    layer.super_attn = layer.attn
    delattr(layer, "attn")
model.transformer.super_h = model.transformer.h
delattr(model.transformer, "h")
# Let's keep the final layer norm as is
# model.transformer.super_ln_f = model.transformer.ln_f
# delattr(model.transformer, "ln_f")
model.super_transformer = model.transformer
delattr(model, "transformer")
print(model)

# %% [markdown]
# now if we try to use nnterp, the renaming check automatically performed will fail:

# %%
from nnterp import StandardizedTransformer
from traceback import print_exc

try:
    StandardizedTransformer(model)
except Exception as e:
    print_exc()

# %% [markdown]
# `nnterp` can't find the layers because they're located under `super_transformer`, that nnterp doesn't know about. We have 2 choices in this case:
# 1. Rename `super_transformer` to `model` and `super_h` to `layers` such that it matches the `model.model.layers` Llama architecture and let `nnterp` do the rest.
# 2. Rename `super_transformer.super_h` directly to `layers`, matching the StandardizedTransformer architecture.
#
# Let's try the second option first. And let's not forget that we still need to rename
#
# In order to do that we can instantiate a `StandardizedTransformer` with a `RenameConfig` with the correct aliases provided.

# %%
from nnterp.rename_utils import RenameConfig

rename_cfg = RenameConfig(
    layers_name="super_transformer.super_h",
    attn_name="super_attn",
    mlp_name="super_mlp",
)
try:
    StandardizedTransformer(model, rename_config=rename_cfg)
except Exception as e:
    print_exc()

# %% [markdown]
# We're still getting an error because `nnterp` doesn't find the `ln_f`. This is because `nnterp` will automatically rename the `ln_f` to `ln_final`, but fails to rename `model.ln_final` to `ln_final`. Again, we can either rename `super_transformer` to `model` or directly rename `super_transformer.ln_f` to `ln_final`.
#
# ⚠️ The code will still fail, because our "super_gpt2" model can't run its forward pass as we deleted its modules.

# ## Adding attention probabilities support

# %% [markdown]
# To access the attention probabilities, `nnterp` uses the `NNsight` ability to hook on most intermediate variables of the forward pass. This is very architecture dependent, as even 2 equivalent models, if they use different names for the intermediate variables, will need different hooks.
#
# As I'm writing this tutorial, I'm adding support for attention probabilities for `GPTJ` models.

# %%
from nnterp import StandardizedTransformer

gptj = StandardizedTransformer(
    "yujiepan/gptj-tiny-random"
)  # In the current version of nnterp, this will work out of the box

# %% [markdown]
# As you can see, when you load a model,`nnterp` will automatically test if the attention probabilities hook is working and returns a tensor of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, seq_len, seq_len)` where the last dimension sums to 1. In this case, the test failed and `nnterp` logs the error.
#
# Now let's look at the `yujiepan/gptj-tiny-random` forward pass and try to understand where are the attention probabilities computed

# %%
from nnterp.utils import display_source

display_source(gptj.attentions[0].source)

# %% [markdown]
# Lines 60-61:
# ```py
#                                 60     # compute self-attention: V x Softmax(QK^T)
#  self__attn_0                -> 61     attn_output, attn_weights = self._attn(query, key, value, attention_mask, head_mask)
#  ```
# ⚠️ Be careful! if you set the hook here, you'll be able to successfully access the attention probabilities, but not to edit them! ⚠️
#
# We need to check the source of `self__attn_0` to see where `attn_weights` is used. In order to access a deeper variable like this, we have to actually run the model with `trace` or `scan`. I'd advise to start with `scan` first, but switch to `trace` if you encounter an error.

# %%
with gptj.scan("a"):
    display_source(gptj.attentions[0].source.self__attn_0.source)

# %% [markdown]
# Here, line 20-24:
# ```py
#  self_attn_dropout_0     -> 20     attn_weights = self.attn_dropout(attn_weights)
#                             21
#                             22     # Mask heads if we want to
#                             23     if head_mask is not None:
#                             24         attn_weights = attn_weights * head_mask
# ```
#
# In the current `NNsight` version, the results of operators like `*` are not hooked. But even if they were, I'd be careful to use line 24 here, as it's inside a `if` statement. Therefore, we'll use `self_attn_dropout_0` instead.
#
# Note that we could also look at `torch_matmul_1` input and edit the value here. However, this looks less robust to me as it assumes this is the only place where `attn_weights` is used.

# ## Summary
#
# `nnterp` provides a unified, standardized interface for working with transformer models, built on top of `nnsight`. Key features include:
#
# 1. **Standardized naming** across all transformer architectures
# 2. **Easy access** to layer/attention/MLP inputs and outputs
# 3. **Built-in methods** for common operations (steering, skipping layers, projecting to vocab)
# 4. **Efficient activation collection** with batching support
# 5. **Prompt utilities** for tracking target tokens
# 6. **Intervention methods** from mechanistic interpretability research
# 7. **Visualization tools** for analyzing model behavior
#
# All of this while maintaining the full power and flexibility of `nnsight` under the hood!

# # Appendix: `NNsight` cheatsheet

# ## 1) You must execute your interventions in order
# In the new `NNsight` versions, it is enforced that you must access to model internals *in the same order* as the model execute them.

except Exception as e:
    print_exc()

# %% [markdown]
# ## 2) Gradient computation
# To compute gradients, you need to open a `.backward()` context, and save the gradients *inside it*.

# %%
with nnterp_gpt2.trace("My tailor is rich"):
    l1_out = nnterp_gpt2.layers_output[1]  # get l1 before accessing logits

# ## 3) Use tracer.stop() to save useless computations
# If you're just computing activations, don't forget to call `tracer.stop()` at the end of your trace. This will stop the model from executing the rest of its computations, and save you some time, as demonstrated below (with the contribution of Claude 4 Sonnet).

# ## 4) Using NNsight builtin cache to collect activations
#
# `NNsight 0.5` introduces a builtin way to cache activations during the forward pass. Be careful not to call `tracer.stop()` before all the module of the cache have been accessed.
#
# The cache supports both renamed and original module names. You can access cached activations using attribute notation or dictionary keys.

# %%
with nnterp_gpt2.trace("Hello") as tracer:
    cache = tracer.cache(modules=[layer for layer in nnterp_gpt2.layers[::2]]).save()

# Access with renamed names using attribute notation
print(cache.model.layers[10].output)
# Or using dictionary syntax with renamed path
print(cache["model.layers.10"].output)
# Original names still work
print(cache["model.transformer.h.10"].output)
