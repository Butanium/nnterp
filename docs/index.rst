nnterp - Neural Network Interpretation Utilities
================================================

``nnterp`` is a tool for researchers learning or using `NNsight <https://github.com/ndif-team/nnsight>`_. 

Similar to `transformer_lens <https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens>`_, nnterp provides a standardized interface for all transformer models. The main difference is that nnterp uses the HuggingFace implementation through nnsight, while transformer_lens uses its own implementation. This means nnterp preserves the original model behavior and supports more architectures.

**You need to know NNsight to use nnterp.** nnterp provides a standardized interface for transformer models and common interventions, making it easier to work with different architectures. But for anything complex, you'll still need NNsight directly.

Note that nnterp doesn't support all models either, since NNsight itself doesn't support all architectures. Additionally, because different models use different naming conventions, nnterp doesn't support all HuggingFace models, but it does support a good portion of them. When a model is loaded in nnterp, automatic tests are performed to verify that the model has been correctly renamed and that nnterp's hooks return the expected shapes. This means that even if an architecture hasn't been officially tested, the simple fact that it loads successfully indicates it's probably working correctly.

nnterp is not a replacement for NNsight - it's an additional tool that researchers can use alongside NNsight for transformer analysis.

What nnterp provides:

- **Unified naming**: ``model.layers_output[5]`` works for GPT-2, LLaMA, Gemma, etc.
- **Common interventions**: logit lens, patchscope, steering built-in
- **HuggingFace compatibility**: Uses original model implementations via nnsight

Quick example:

.. code-block:: python

   from nnterp import StandardizedTransformer
   
   model = StandardizedTransformer("gpt2")  # or any transformer
   with model.trace("Hello"):
       layer_5_out = model.layers_output[5]  # same API for all models
